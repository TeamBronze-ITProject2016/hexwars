# Hexwars!
## About
Hexwars is a 2D mobile gaming app designed for Android phones. The basics of the game involves a small hexagon, controlled by the player, which is vulnerable to collision attacks from other nearby hexagons, controlled by other players. To play the game, you must increase your score by colliding into and defeating the other hexagons. Players gain points by destroying small destructible objects in the environment, as well as other hexagons. These points can be spent to upgrade the playerâ€™s hexagon by attaching new parts (of various shapes) to it.
